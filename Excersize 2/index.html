    <h1>Ten Principles for Good Design Through the Art of<a href="https://x.com/guilhernunes_/media">Guilherme Nunes</a></h1>
    <h2>By Dieter Rams</h2>

<h3>1. Good design is<u>innovative</u></h3>

    <p class="styled-paragraph">
        The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. <br>But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>2. Good design makes a product<u>useful</u></h3>
         <img src="G-uodJ_W4AEt7Dn.jpg" height="400">
    <p class="styled-paragraph">
        A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. <br>Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</p>
    <h3>3. Good design is<u>aesthetic</u></h3>
        <img src="G_B25tRXQAExvCb.jpg" height="400">
       <p class="styled-paragraph">
        The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. <br>But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>
    <h3>4. Good design makes a product <u>understandable</u></h3>
        <img src="G_WmeYHXcAAFIvz.jpg" height="400">
       <p class="styled-paragraph">
        It clarifies the product's structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.</p>
    <h3>5. Good design is <u>unobtrusive</u></h3>
       <img src="G_WQ-_sXMAA5Y75.jpg" height="400">
       <p class="styled-paragraph">
        Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art.<br> Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.</p>
    <h3>6. Good design is <u>honest</u></h3>
        <img src="G-KkHeIXgAAScOe.jpg" height="400">
       <p class="styled-paragraph">
        It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. <br>It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p>
    <h3>7. Good design is <u>long-lasting</u></h3>
        <img src="G_m_gnfW8AAryxV.jpg" height="400">
       <p class="styled-paragraph">
        It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, <br>it lasts many years - even in today's throwaway society.</p>
    <h3>8. Good design is <u>thorough</u> down to the last detail  </h3>
        <img src="G_sHLzbXwAAz90f.jpg" height="400">
       <p class="styled-paragraph">
        Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.</p>
    <h3>9. Good design is <u>environmentally-friendly</u></h3>
        <img src="G-lGp7sXAAAVJvD.jpg" height="400">
       <p class="styled-paragraph">
        Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. <br>It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</p>
    <h3>10. Good design is as <u>little</u> design as possible</h3>
        <img src="G_H2l5jWYAAVmpu.jpg" height="400">
       <p class="styled-paragraph">Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, <br>and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.</p>
