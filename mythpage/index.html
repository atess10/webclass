    <p>-Japanese Macaques are the basis for the three wise monkeys that hear, see, and speak no evil. The original version of the proverb was found carved on a wooden panel in the Toshogu Shrine in Nikko, Japan. (NEPC)</p><b></b>
<p>-Shinto faith depicts Japanese macaques as accompanying Raijin, the god of lightning. (NEPC)</p><b></b>
<p>-Monkeys in Japanese mythology are used as a warding against demons because the word for monkey is the same as the word for expel in the Japanese language. “Saru.” (Onmark Productions)
